# Metacognition

- Being aware of one's own thought processes.
- Very closely related to meta-knowledge (see below).

### Self-reflection and self-criticism

### The rubber-ducky (or platypus) method

- Projection onto others (get out of your own head!),
- Empathy, and the "teacher's mind".

### Meta-cognitive vocabulary starter pack

- Have I *overlooked* something *obvious*?
- Have I considered all the *possibilities*?
- Have I used too little or too much *soft focus* or *hard focus*?
- Do I have the right *approach*?
- Am I aware of the *big picture / small picture*?
- Is my approach *too general* or *too specific*?
- What is the *context*? What are the *implicit assumptions*?
- Which *modality* and *paradigm* are best suited for this?
- Did I take a *shortcut*? If so, *why*?
- I know it works, but *why / how*?
- Is my approach *necessary*, or *contingent* (just *happens to work*)?
- Can I *explain / teach* this to *someone else*?
- Do others think about this *differently* than I do?

## Work in progress!
