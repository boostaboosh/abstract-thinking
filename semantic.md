# Semantic thinking and predicates

## Syntax vs semantics

- Constant tension between symbols and meaning.
- Different possible worlds and interpretations.
- Going back and forth between formal and informal, axioms and models.
- Deep connection and equivalence between syntax and semantics:

| Correspondence             |         Syntax |  ↔   | Semantics      |
| :------------------------- | -------------: | :--: | -------------- |
| Soundness and Completeness |    Provability |  ↔   | Truth          |
| Soundness and Completeness | Abstract proof |  ↔   | Concrete model |
| Curry-Howard Isomorphism   |         Proofs |  ↔   | Programs       |

## Work in progress!
