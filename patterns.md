# Patterns

- Humans are comparison machines, which give rise to *order patterns*.
- Humans also see spatial patterns, which give rise to *geometric / topological patterns*.
- Humans are story-oriented, which gives rise to "...and then..." style *temporal patterns*.
  - Some of these can also be viewed as *causal patterns*.
- Humans see and form relations everywhere between things / people, which give rise to *relational patterns*.
- Humans observe / exhibit behaviors and think behaviorally, which gives rise to *behavioral patterns*.

## Work in progress!
