# Problem Solving

- Explain the mental models and patterns of mathematical ideas:
  - structural build-up from axioms by following rules;
  - the (cumulative) past determines the present;
  - how abstraction works, infinite families of mathematical objects;
  - what properties / predicates are and how to detect them;
  - ??? (more)
- The art of problem solving:
  - Wishful thinking and making wish lists;
  - Outside-the-box, or lateral thinking: "putting out fires with sound";
  - Goal-oriented solving: start at the end, work backward;
  - Domain analysis, problem breakdown, solution design (blueprinting);
  - Look at it from real up close, look at it from ten miles away;
  - search for a solution = proof search in a proof tree;
  - ??? (more)

## "Convert, solve, convert back" paradigm

- Algebraic topology / number theory / analytic geometry:
  - take a problem in topology / numbers / geometry,
  - convert to algebra,
  - solve the algebraic problem,
  - convert back to topology / numbers / geometry.
- Laplace transform in differential equations is a perfect example.
- Many, many more examples in all areas of math and CS.

## Work in progress!
