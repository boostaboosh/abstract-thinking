# Axiomatic thinking

- Axioms are the same as the idea of "primitives" in programming:
  - basic building blocks that cannot be broken down any further,
  - but everything else can be built up from them.
  - Synchronization primitives for concurrency,
  - Geometric primitives for graphics, etc.

## Work in progress
