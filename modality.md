# Modalities

Changing:

- the ***active agent*** and the nature of ***knowledge*** (epistemology):
  - "something is true" vs. "*I know* something is true" vs. "something is *provable*",
- the ***nature of truth***:
  - *necessary truth* vs. *possible truth* vs. *contingent truth*,
- the ***type and goal of the activity***:
  - *calculating* vs. *proving* vs. *exploring* vs. *guessing / heuristics*,
- and the ***accuracy***:
  - *deterministic* vs *probabilistic / stochastic*,
  - *exact* vs *approximate*.
