# Elements of Abstract Thinking

## What this is *not*:

- This is not about abstract thinking in the broadest sense:
  - in art,
  - in science,
  - in politics,
  - in religion,
  - in military,
  - in decision making,
  - etc.
- This is about ***abstract thinking within the context of mathematics and computer science.***
  - There are similarities to the scientific method:
    - observations, hypotheses, evidence, testing 
  - but they are not the focus.

## ***First, the human side of things:***

## Pattern recognition

[Link to the Patterns section](./patterns.md)

- Humans are pattern recognition machines.
  - So much so, that [we see patterns where there aren't any](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia).
- Patterns can be found in anything: syntax, semantics, structures, problems, solutions, domains...
- Humans are also comparison machines, which give rise to order structures.
- Humans also see spatial patterns, which give to geometric / topological structures.
- Humans are story-oriented, they love "...and then..." style temporal patterns.

## Connections to the physical world

[Link to the Physical world section](physical.md)

- addition, subtraction <-> putting things together, removing things
- transformation <-> bending / stretching / shifting objects
- modus ponens <-> cause and effect
- traits / polymorphism <-> genetics
- recursion <-> plants, shells, other life forms
- software architecture <-> physical architecture
- neural networks <-> human brain

## Syntax: symbolic thinking and symbol manipulation

[Link to Symbolic thinking section](symbolic.md)

- Again, ubiquitous for humans (language, writing, numbers etc.)
- Symbols = syntax = formal = mechanical = unintuitive.

## Semantics: domains and predicates

[Link to Semantic thinking section](semantic.md)

- We have patterns / models in our brains through the physical world and our senses.
- Worlds = semantics = informal = meaningful = intuitive = interpretation.
- Humans can never agree on worlds and interpretations, keep fighting over which is "right".

## ***Now the more technical side of things:***

## Syntax vs semantics

- Constant tension between symbols and meaning.
- Different possible worlds and interpretations.
- Going back and forth between formal and informal, axioms and models.
- Deep connection and equivalence between syntax and semantics:
  - Soundness and completeness: Provability <-> Truth,
  - Abstract proof <-> Concrete model,
  - Curry-Howard correspondence: Proofs <-> Programs.

## Modalities and paradigms

- Switching between "thinking styles":
  - some problems are better conceived / modeled in certain ways than others.
- Switching between "expression styles":
  - some solutions are better expressed in certain ways than others.

### Modalities

[Link to Modalities section](modality.md)

- Changing the "active agent", the "nature of truth" (epistemology) and the input-output relations:
  - "something is true" vs. "I know something is true",
  - "necessary truth" vs. "possible truth" vs. "contingent truth",
  - calculating vs. proving vs. exploring vs. guessing / heuristics,
  - deterministic vs random / probabilistic.

### Paradigms

[Link to Paradigms section](paradigm.md)

- Changing the focal point through which the world is viewed and expressed:
  - Calculus / analysis / continuous math:
    - "Everything is whole, together, inseparable, uncountable, unreal, and infinitesimally smooth."
    - "Best we can hope for is a local approximation that gets precise at infinity."
  - Discrete math: "Everything is separate, individual, countable, jagged, real and precise."
  - OOP: "I, the object, am the center of the world."
    - Everything is local, noun-based and locally-state-based.
  - FP: "Universal verbs from the heavens (functions) act on us all."
    - Everything is global, verb-based but no state (timeless).
  - Logic P: "Everything is a proof search tree. Nothing else exists." 
  - Imperative P: "World is a chaotic mess of forever changing states. Keep up with it!"
    - Everything is global, temporal, side-effect-based and globally-state-based.

## Domain modeling

[Link to Modeling section](model.md)

- Parts of structural, reductionist, axiomatic, and rule-based thinking (see below).
- A family of models correspond directly to axioms that they satisfy.
- Possible worlds and interpretations.

## Relations and connections

[Link to the Relations section](relation.md)

- Lots of things are based on relations:
  - Graphs (social networks, GraphQL),
  - Databases (relational set theory),
  - OOP (UML diagrams, concept maps), many more.
- Connections are informal, conceptual relations.

## Structural thinking

[Link to the Structures section](structure.md)

- Realizing the semantics. Capturing semantics in a concrete way.
- Algebraic, topological, relational, and order structures.
- Combined, rich, complex structures: analytical, geometric, ergodic / stochastic.

### Spaces and transformations
### Operations, iterations and closures

## Temporal thinking

[Link to the Time section](time.md)

- chronological, state-based and event-based (discrete vs. continuous)
- Mutation
- striking connections with timeless, stateless thinking!

### States, transitions, state machines (automata)

## Axiomatic thinking

[Link to the Axiomatic thinking section](axiom.md)

- Realizing the syntax. Capturing syntax in a precise way.
- Axioms are the same as the idea of "primitives" in programming:
  - basic building blocks that cannot be broken down any further,
  - but everything else can be built up from them.
  - Synchronization primitives for concurrency,
  - Geometric primitives for graphics, etc.

## Critical Thinking

[Link to Critical thinking section](critical.md)

- It boils down to: ***NEGATION!***
- Fruitful interaction with axiomatic thinking: negate the axioms!
  - Power of negation: [Hyperbolic geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFlu60qs7_4)

## Generalization and Specialization

- Universal (for all) and existential (there exists) quantification.
- Abstraction and reification (concretization).

### Higher-order and categorical thinking

## Rule-based thinking

- Completely controlled world that:
  - obeys rules,
  - is built gradually from earlier stages,
  - offers strict guarantees (invariants).

## Reductionist (atomic) thinking
- Break into smaller parts,
  - then even smaller,
  - then even smaller than that,
  - until the smallest parts are self-evident,
  - and keep track of the connections.
- The whole *equals* the sum of the parts.
- This works with wishful thinking.

## Recursive thinking

[Link to Recursive thinking section](recursive.md)

- Self-reference and self-similarity (fractals)
- This is found in nature, biology recurs (insert fractal broccoli picture here)
- Notoriously difficult for humans!
  - It's "anti-temporal" or "reverse-chronological" thinking,
  - but humans are story-oriented creatures.
- Connection with structural thinking: self-similar structures (fractals).

## Meta-thinking
- All these ways of thinking can *compound* and *recurse* on each other:
  - we can have a pattern that generalizes to a bigger domain,
  - which satisfies some predicates that define a modality,
  - which has a connection with another predicate from a bigger pattern,
  - and this connection has a form that applies more generally to other connections between other domains,
  - and so on and so on infinitely!
- Good example: going from Gauss-Bonnet theorem to Riemann-Roch theorem to Atiyah-Singer index theorem.

## ***Back to the human side:***

## Metacognition

- Being aware of one's own thought processes.
- Very closely related to meta-knowledge (see below).

### Self-reflection and self-criticism

### The rubber-ducky (or platypus) method
- Projection onto others (get out of your own head!),
- Empathy, and the "teacher's mind".

### Meta-cognitive vocabulary starter pack
- Have I *overlooked* something *obvious*?
- Have I considered all the *possibilities*?
- Have I used too little or too much *soft focus* or *hard focus*?
- Do I have the right *approach*?
- Am I aware of the *big picture / small picture*?
- Is my approach *too general* or *too specific*?
- What is the *context*? What are the *implicit assumptions*?
- Which *modality* and *paradigm* are best suited for this?
- Did I take a *shortcut*? If so, *why*?
- I know it works, but *why / how*?
- Is my approach *necessary*, or *contingent* (just *happens to work*)?
- Can I *explain / teach* this to *someone else*?
- Do others think about this *differently* than I do?

## Implicit and explicit knowledge
- Assumptions and "background knowledge" are unavoidable, and necessary.
- Always keep "dancing back and forth" between:
  - implicit and explicit knowledge,
  - syntax and semantics,
  - formal and informal,
  - abstract and concrete,
  - yourself and others,
  - theoretical and practical.
- Being aware of:
  - what's needed,
  - what's missing,
  - the surrounding context,
  - to which paradigm / modality something belongs,
  - self and other-knowledge (see below).
- Make it explicit!
  - Play the role of "math lawyer": write a *bullet-proof definition*.
### Implicit conversions
- Converting one idea / concept / assumption to another, without being aware of it.
- Found in math, programming, and a natural function of our brains.
  - which makes it an interesting example of meta-thinking!
- It happens all the time without us noticing.

## Metaknowledge

- I know something.
  - I know that I know it.
  - I *learned it*, I *should* know it but I'm not confident.
  - To convince myself I should teach it to others.
- I don't know *something*.
  - Sometimes I don't know that I don't know something.
  - Sometimes I can *feel* that I lack something, but I don't know *what it is that I don't know.*
    - I call this ***hitting the wall of meta-knowledge.*** (OUCH)
  - I know what I lack, but I don't know where to go or how to acquire it.
- I know what others don't, or I don't know what others know.
  - Others don't know that I know something.
  - I know that I know something but I can't explain it to others.
    - I'm not sure if *they* know what I'm talking about.
    - Are they missing some prerequisite knowledge to understand it?
  - I can't understand what others "see" in something.
    - They get it, I don't, and I'm not sure why.
    - Am I missing some prerequisite knowledge to understand it?

# How to think abstractly
![abstraction-hierarchy](images/abstraction.png)

- Here, we can add logic as an external meta-abstraction that applies to ALL of these.
  - With arrows pointing from Logic to each one.

- Start with real-world, often physical, observations of objects,
- Remove "special properties" (or "context") from the real world:
  - If you are looking at a picture with three different lions, remove their differences,
  - and then remove their "animalness", etc.
  - this is called making it "context-free".
- Look for:
  - relations between them,
  - operations that act on them,
  - properties they might have.
  - This is the most difficult part and cannot be taught completely.
- Now see if the objects can be replaced with others.
  - Do the properties / relations still hold?
- Now see if the operations could be replaced with others:
  - Do they still work?

# Problem solving

[Link to Problem Solving section](solve.md)

- Explain the mental models and patterns of mathematical ideas:
  - structural build-up from axioms by following rules;
  - the (cumulative) past determines the present;
  - how abstraction works, infinite families of mathematical objects;
  - what properties / predicates are and how to detect them;
  - ??? (more)
- The art of problem solving:
  - Wishful thinking and making wish lists;
  - Outside-the-box, or lateral thinking: "putting out fires with sound";
  - Goal-oriented solving: start at the end, work backward;
  - Domain analysis, problem breakdown, solution design (blueprinting);
  - Look at it from real up close, look at it from ten miles away;
  - search for a solution = proof search in a proof tree;
  - ??? (more)
## "Convert, solve, convert back" paradigm

- Algebraic topology / number theory / analytic geometry:
  - take a problem in topology / numbers / geometry,
  - convert to algebra,
  - solve the algebraic problem,
  - convert back to topology / numbers / geometry.
- Laplace transform in differential equations is a perfect example.
- Many, many more examples in all areas of math and CS.
