# Meta-thinking

- All the other ways of thinking can *recur* and *compound* on each other:
  - we can have a pattern that generalizes to a bigger domain,
  - which satisfies some predicates that define a modality,
  - which has a connection with another predicate from a bigger pattern,
  - and this connection has a form that applies more generally to other connections between other domains,
  - and so on and so on infinitely!
- Good example: going from [Gauss-Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem) to [Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem) to [Riemann-Roch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Roch_theorem) to [Atiyah-Singer index theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah%E2%80%93Singer_index_theorem).
