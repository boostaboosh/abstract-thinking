# Paradigms

## Math paradigms

### Calculus / analysis / continuous math

- "Everything is whole, together, inseparable, uncountable, unreal, and infinitesimally smooth."
- "Best we can hope for is a local approximation that gets precise at infinity."

### Discrete math

- "Everything is separate, individual, countable, jagged, real and precise."

## Programming paradigms

### OOP

- "I, the object, am the center of the world."

- Everything is local, noun-based and locally-state-based.

### FP

- "Universal verbs from the heavens (functions) act on us all."

- Everything is global, verb-based but no state (timeless).

### Logic Programming

- "Everything is a proof search tree. Nothing else exists." 

### Imperative Programming

- "World is a chaotic mess of forever changing states. Keep up with it!"
- Everything is global, temporal, side-effect-based and globally-state-based.

## Local vs Global thinking
